# Backend Information

Hey, I'm Uday ðŸ‘‹

You've come a long way into my project files!  
If you're reading this, I appreciate your curiosity. Hope you're doing great!

This project includes a backend folder containing these main files:

- `server.js` â€” the main backend server script  
- `db.js` â€” database connection and queries. The backend connects to a free database service hosted at [https://dash.filess.io/](https://dash.filess.io/) and can be deployed on platforms like Render.  
- `package.json` â€” Node.js dependencies and scripts  

Used to run backend: [https://render.com/](https://render.com/)

Although the backend folder and files are present, **I have not actively used this backend for the wedding invitation website deployment**.  
My deployed site uses the frontend hosted on GitHub Pages.  
The backend code is originally based on and modified from the open-source [Undangan](https://github.com/dewanakl/undangan) project. I adapted the open-source backend and filtered comments in my own way to fit my needs.
